      The purpose of this website is to maintain artifacts for my CSCI-712 
      (<span class="font-italic font-weight-light">Computer Animation: Algorithms and Techniques</span>) project. A significant
      component of this course is to explore an interesting area of computer animation that isn't covered by the core
      material.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/mradfo21/status/1168647985455960065">This tweet</a> from Matthew Radford is really interesting! 
      I'd like to try and re-create this effect based on some of the breadcrumbs that he left behind in the Twitter thread, while
      also getting a better appreciation for the fundamentals of fluid simulation.

      There appear to be similar effects in Remedy's <span class="font-weight-bold">Control</span> (2019) as well, so I'll cite both
      as my primary source of inspiration.
